```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(leaflet)
library(readxl)
```

## The assignment

Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.

Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity!

## The map

```{r}
#Load some data
AAS_coordinates <- read_excel("AAS_coordinates.xlsx")
head(AAS_coordinates)

#Plot the map
AAS_coordinates %>% 
  leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions(),popup = ~as.character(name), label = ~as.character(name))

```
